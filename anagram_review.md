# Code Review: AnagramGrouper

> **NOTE**:
<br><li> The lines referenced in this review refer to the lines in the `anagram.py` file provided.
<br><li>Also see the revised code in the `anagram_revised.py` file provided.


## Correctness:
- The code is mostly correct, but it does not produce the expected output. This is caused by the following issues:

    - **Indentation**: The `groupAnagrams` function needs to be indented properly.

    - **Function Arguments**: The `sorted()` function on line 7 should take the argument `i` to sort the current string. In this case, the `sorted()` function is called without any arguments, which would raise a `TypeError`.

- Using a dictionary to group the anagrams is an efficient and easy approach to understand.

## Efficiency:
- The code is reasonably efficient because using a dictionary to group the anagrams is efficient and easy approach to understand. This is beacause the dictionary provides constant-time access to keys, which decreases the time complexity, thus increasing efficiency.
- Moreover, the efficiency depends on the use case of the code as large inputs might affect efficiency when sorting which would require exploring different sorting algorithms to potentially increasing the efficiency.

## Style:
- The code is written in a clean manner and is concise.
- Although, the naming conventions in the code could be improved to make the code more readable, as follows: 
    - The class name `Solution` on line 3 can be replaced with a more descriptive name such as `AnagramGrouper` based on the context provided and its functionality.
    - The function name `groupAnagrams` does not conform to the PEP8 naming convention (snake case naming style) and should be replace with the snake-case name `group_anagrams`.
    - The variable name `strs` on line 4 can be replaced with a more descriptive name such as `word_list`.
    - The variable name `result` on line 5 can be replaced with a more descriptive name such as `anagram_groups`.
    - The variable `i` on line 6 can be replaced with a more descriptive name such as `word`.
    - The variable `x` on line 7 can be replaced with a more descriptive name such as `anagram`.
    - The class instance `ob1` on line 13 should be replaced with a suitable name such as `anagram_grouper`.

- The weak typed language style is used in this code, which is common since Python is a dynamically typed language.
- However, using the strong typed language style will help improve the reliability, performance, debugging and maintainability of code. The following changes can improve the quality of the code:

    - Adding the return type `list`, for the `groupAnagrams` on line 4.
    - Declaring the variable type for `result` on line 5, which is a `dict`.
    - Declaring the variable type for `x` in line 7, which is a `str`.

## Documentation:
- There is a lack of documentation - adding some comments or docstrings to explain the code logic would make it more readable.
- The code documentation can be improved as follows:
    - Adding the `Solution` class docstring, below line 3, for example:
        ```python
        class Solution:
            """A class for grouping words into sets of anagrams."
            """
        ```
    - Adding the `groupAnagrams` function docstring, below line 4, for example:
        ```python
        def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
            """Groups a list of words into a list of anagrams.

            :param strs: A list of strings to group.
            :type strs: list[str]
            :returns: a list of lists, where each list contains a group of anagrams
            :rtype: list
            """
        ```
    - Adding in-line comments to explain the logic in the code.

## Positive Aspects:
- Overall, the code is mostly correct, clean and efficient.
- The approach of using a dictionary to group the anagrams together is efficient and easy to understand.
- With some minor changes, the code could be more readable and easier to understand.Keep up the good work!

## Improvements
- Proper indentation of the `groupAnagrams` function.
- Using more descriptive names for the variable, function and class names.
- Use strong typed language, especially for the function return types.
- Check and test code meticulously, to avoid potential unexpected errors such as runtime errors caused by `IndentationErrors` arguments or `TypeErrors` etc.
- Add sufficient documentation where need such as comments or docstrings to explain the code logic for better readability and usability.
